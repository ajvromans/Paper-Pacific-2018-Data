The data has been produced by two different programs: The NewGypsum4 MATLAB code with standard, S and P modifications and a Parameters call-function. The .....  Mathematica code. 

The .... Mathematica code was used to create the data and plots of Figures 11 and 12 of the paper.
The NewGypsum4 MATLAB code was used to create the data of Figures 2 to 10 of the paper.

The Figures 2, 3 and 4 only use the positive time-stamp value minus 1 of the first zero-solution in the data.
Figure 5 uses only the height data of several simulations as indicated in the paper.
Figures 6 to 10 show the displacement and height data of a single simulation.
Figures 11 to 12 show the velocity data of a simulation with the other code at the same parameters.

We have added all the data of a single simulation, even if only the time-stamp is used. 
How to read the data? 
Data produced by NewGypsum4 is in Table form with time-dependence in columns, and position-dependence in rows.
